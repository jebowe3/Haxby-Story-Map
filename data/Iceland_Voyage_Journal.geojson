{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "text": "Science<br><br>We’re enjoying very quiet weather. I don’t remember ever sailing with wind and waves this quiet. Great for data collection. Some clouds have rolled in, but nothing threatening, yet.<br><br>We’re cruising along at a jogging pace – about 5 knots – which is optimum for collecting multichannel seismic (MCS) data. With MCS, an explosion from the air guns (2 guns) is listened to by 48 electronic ears (hydropohones or “channels”) trailing behind the ship on a cable 600 meters long. They listen for echoes (reflections) from the sea floor, and from geologic layers beneath the sea floor. We can “see” about 1 kilometer beneath the seafloor. If we go too fast, the ears start bouncing around and generally misbehaving; if we go too slow, we don’t go anywhere. The MCS data are being processed on board ship, instead of just archiving them for processing back at Lamont. After some aggravating software problems, we’re beginning to see some results, and some of those results are quite interesting (Science – check). My role in the MCS effort is to walk by from time-to-time and say “Wow!”, or “Ooh”. This role, like all my responsibilities, I take very seriously.<br><br>My main responsibility is to manage the multibeam data. These map the seafloor along a swath, with a width about 3 times the water depth, centered on the ship’s track. Maybe I’ll write more about multibeam later in the cruise.<br><br>Filling in some details on shiboard life:<br><br>I have my own room (cabin), which is on the floor (deck) just below water level. Hence – no porthole. I share a bathroom with one other guy – Peter Buhl, with whom I flew to Iceland. Meals are at 7:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. The food is excellent, and served in great heaps, unless you request a modest helping. Two nights ago was Mexican night – enchiladas, refried beans mexican rice, etc., and beer(!). I believe I am allowed two beers this cruise. Smoking is not permitted inside, only outside, “on deck,” which means that I am smoking less, and going on deck a lot, both of which are good things. I work in the SeaBeam (brand-name for WHOIs multibeam) lab, which is one deck above the main lab, and two above my cabin. Typically, I am either alone here, or share it with one of the students; students are doing the “ping editing” – examining the multibeam data for bad data. Most of my time in the lab is spent on processing the multibeam and writing software.", "latitude": 61.38741, "longitude": -22.143932, "time": "21:00:00", "day": "2002-08-07", "temp": null, "date": "7-Aug-02", "id": 2 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -22.143596, 61.387192 ] } },

The GGC (“giant gravity core”) is on deck, and the JPC (“jumbo piston core”) is on its way down. We will be under way again in about 2 hours, heading for Greenland’s seas. When we arrive, our target will be the great “Eirik Drift” which is a heap of mud – one of the biggest heaps in the world – much bigger than the puny “Gardar Drift,” which we have now left behind. Ours will be the definitive work on Eirik for some years to come. Everyone working on mud heaps will have to read and cite our work. Immortality – check.<br><br>When we are coring, the ship’s location is maintained by its “dynamic positioning system.” A computer monitors GPS and fires the thrusters when appropriate to keep the ship within 1–2 meters of the same position for the 2-or-so hours it takes for the coring operation.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "text": "Last night, we — Greg Mountain, (chief scientest), Peter Buhl (MCS specialist), Jim Wright and Pat Manley (co-investigaros), and Ellen Somebody (coring specialist), and me (?!) — sat out on deck for about two hours enjoying a warm quiet, sunny evening. The sunset was the best yet. Whales passed by in the distance. We could see them spout, and occasionally we could make out a shape. A golden evening. Now, the wind is up to about 30 knots, it’s raining periodically, and the ship is bouncing around fairly impressively. We are sailing through a storm. The captain says it will probably last another 24 hours. Although the weather has been by-and-large very good, our golden evening was, I fear, a one-time event. A gift.<br><br>We’re off the hook for dinner tonight. Rescheduled for the transit back to Iceland. Just as well. If it’s a disaster, then the crew will overlook it – they will be in high spirits as we head into port.<br><br>We’re making up a watch list for an “ice watch” at the captains request. This is evidently a heavy ice year, and as we survey close to Greenland (maybe as close as 30 mi.) we will have to pay attention. The most dangerous ice is the big chunks that the icebergs shed as they melt – “growlers” that barely break the surface and so are virtually undetectable by radar.

Still are — I just came back in. They cover the sky from east to west, right above the ship. There aren’t different colors, just white, so at first they just look like wispy clouds. But then you notice that they slowly shimmer — if you look in one part of the sky for a minute-or-so, they will become diffuse and fade, then sharpen into focus in another curtainy pattern. Impressive. Northern Lights – check.<br><br>I am mildly disturbed by my inability to sleep for more than 3–6 hours. Today, after my “ice watch” (1100–1200), I’ll try an afternoon nap. Morning are no problem. But with only 3 hrs the night before, I fade fast in the afternoon and evening. Maybe it was the aurora that woke me up today.<br><br>We have begun the last and largest survey of the cruise. Science watches, discontinued for the transit, have recommenced, to the dismay of the students (well, tough), and will continue until the last (2 day) transit back to Iceland. I can’t believe we haven’t even reached the half-way point (“hump day” is Thurs., I think).<br><br>The front passed us just about the time I woke up (maybe that’s what woke me), and the sky is now cloudless, with stars and aurora. It’s noticeably cooler. Air temperature is about 45 F, slightly cooler than the water.

The weather, which quieted down over night, is predicted to deterioriate (and not just be the red sunrise).<br><br>The scientists are dismayed by the limitations imposed by the ice conditions on the planned survey. Yes, there is ice. I saw a couple of icebergs through binoculars yesterday (icebergs – check). The trouble is – the captain insists on slowing down to a crawl during the nighttime, if we are in the icy regions, and especially if there is fog. This is all right for preserving the ship and people’s lives and so on, but the science suffers as a result. Tough call. The science suffers because our productivity is directly proportional to the distance logged, and also because the multibeam data are awful when we are wallowing at 2–4 knots.

Me – “Dr. Waypoint.” Actually, the scientists tell me approximately where they want to go, then I choose the way points that most efficiently satisfy their wants, while making sure we don’t duplicate past survey lines. This is complicated by bad weather. Sometimes, when we give the bridge our way points, they veto them because of the weather, so it’s back to the drawing board.
