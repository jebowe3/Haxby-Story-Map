Arrived at the ship yesterday afternoon, around 1 pm, after about 36 hours of travelling. It’s summer here. Walking back to the ship last night about 7:00 after a couple beers at a local pub (one of many), it felt strange that the day was so warm and bright at that time of night. Of course, the strangeness might have something to do with the fact that I had only ~8 hrs of sleep in the past 60 hours, plus jet lag, plus all the rest of it. I went to sleep around 7:30 last night, after forcing myself to stay up as long as possible. Woke up around 4:30, and caught the sunrise.<br><br>The ship is in Lyttleton harbour, a small port town separated from Christchurch by a rugged ridge, and connected to it by a tunnel. It’s lovely. The harbour is an ancient volcanic crater, and the surrounding hills are pretty spectacular. Hope to have some time to trek around up there in the next week.<br><br>We sail next Wednesday (which we call Tuesday back home). My cabin is large and comfortable, with a private bathroom. The ship seems quite spacious, although I expect it to shrink in the next two months. Lots of people around. I’m still sorting them out. Some will sail with us, some not. Of the scientific party, only Steve Cande, the senior chief scientist and my travelling companion of the past 2 days, and Suzanne Ohara, our computer support person, have arrived. Others will trickle in over the next week. The technicians and crew are a friendly lot. I know a couple of them from Lamont. Looks like we’ll be eating well.

I haven’t been able to sit down and organize my thoughts. Not because I’m all that busy, I’m just flaky. I spend most of my time in the science lab, where the data is always being recorded, and people are always milling about. Watching the picture of the sea floor unfold is very compelling. It doesn’t happen fast enough to overwhelm you, just fast enough that you have time to think about what it all means and try to predict what’s coming next. I lose track of time out here. The days are carbon copies of one another. I have to think hard to figure out what day of the week it is, and how long we’ve been out. It’s been 8 ½ days so far, I just figured out. We’re at 70 S latitude and 154.9 west longitude (that’s 205.1 on the map I gave you) and still heading south. I saw my first iceberg 2 days ago (or was it 3?), and they’ve been menacing the ship ever since (not really – it’s light all the time, and the ship has radar which can spot them miles away). I was just on deck as we threaded our way through a half dozen of the monsters. They are awesome, rising 100-150 ft above the waves, sometimes a half mile or more wide. While watching them march by, a whale swam with us for a while (my first this trip). It swam right off the bow for a few minutes. Leaning over the bow, we could see it swimming just beneath the waves, breaking the surface once or twice. I don’t know what kind it was. Maybe an orca or pilot whale. The other memorable critter of the trip is the albatross. We were surrounded by them (maybe 5 or 6 at a time) up until a couple days ago. They are splendid to watch. They never flap their wings and never rest on the water (at least, not that I saw). They just soar around and around, scimming the waves, often seeming to dip their wing tip into the water on a banked turn.<br><br>Except for the occasional venture outside, sometimes only once or twice per day, I am occupied in the lab. Sometimes I sleep, but that’s been a minor problem. I can’t seem to hit on a daily schedule that feels natural. The last two days I’ve slept 4 hours in the morning and 4 in the evening. No wonder it doesn’t feel natural -- 12 hour days! Next I’ll try a prime number of hours per day.\n\nThe weather has been very kind. Smooth sailing since we left Lyttleton. The weather maps showed gales all around us between 45 S and 60 S, but we managed to thread a path between them. A very low probability occurrence, I’m told. The days are cool, probably like New York at this time of year, and mostly overcast, with some snow.\n\nI hope all is well.\n\nLove, Bill", "GMT_date": "24-Jan-92", "GMT_time": "9:00:25", "long": -154.78148, "lat": -69.98231, "long_360": 205.21852 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 205.21852, -69.98231 ] } },

Your words painted a fantastic picture of your majestic seascape. At S 70 you are just about off the edge of our copy of your world. It will be interesting to learn how far south you penetrate, but keep that radar in good condition. Hope you continue to sight exotic birds and beasts, but I don’t think I want to set the stage for monster icebergs.<br><br>We are not surprised at your disorientation, considering your double hemispheric change, loss of landmarks and dark nights, the novelty and interest of both surroundings and soundings, and the completely new work schedule. How do you handle the last? 4-hour watches twice a day (as in the navy)? or 8-hour watches? How do you handle meals? 24-hours buffet or three sets of “normal” meals? Does everyone get fat, or are you starting to take exercise time? The clock seems to be your only external regulator, as if you were on a space voyage. But routine is sure to develop.<br><br>I infer that 24-hour data recording is the regimen. Your data are displayed, then, as a strip of a 3-dimensional contour map of the bottom? How wide is the strip? What is the depth range in those parts? Is shadowing a problem? Do icebergs affect your data? Any surprises so far? Sorry about all these questions, but my curiosity is finally kicking in, and my own experience is no help.<br><br>You did not mention receiving any E-mail from us. This one is our third. We’d like a little reassurance that the sending system is working. Let us know. Jamie told us Sunday, Jan 26, that he had not yet heard from you via E-mail. Your letter to us was timed 0900 Jan 24 GMT. We figure that translates to about 0300 CST, same day. We don’t know when he checked for E-mail, nor whether or when you sent something off to him.

I think I detect improvement. Mimi is healthy and busy, even played tennis this morning. Our serious X-country starts this coming weekend at Ely (YMCA Camp Northland). Mine will not be very serious.

It’s good to hear from you. So far, I’ve only written to Janie, via friends at Lamont, and you, not including work stuff (the draw-back of e-mail; it used to be when you went to sea you were really out of reach). I like hearing about the goings on on the other side of the planet. My world here is so limited that I can easily begin to feel remote and detached from everything else, which isn’t healthy, but it’s me.<br><br>I like thinking of you venturing off on your serious X-country skiing trips (I hope your ankle heals quick, Dad, so it doesn’t hamper you). It’s a good mental picture. Enjoy.<br><br>Here’s what’s happening. We finished the south-most part of the survey. Made it to 72 degrees 25 minutes South, and could have kept going. We never reached the pack, just lots of icebergs. I’m disappointed we didn’t see the penguins, but we could accomplish more by turning. Now we’re “mowing the lawn” – surveying the fracture zone with long, parallel lines such that the bathymetric swaths just touch, so that we get 100% bathymetric coverage in an area about 700 km long and 60–70 km wide, centered on the fracture zone and the ridge axis. We do about 450 km per day, and the swaths are twice the water depth, so we need to run line between 5 and 7 km apart (depths vary from about 2500 to 3500 m). So you can work out the numbers. It will take a while.<br><br>We can see the data coming in in a number of ways. There’s a large pen plotter which plots the bathymetry in real time, and we can see the seismics, showing depth and near surface crustal structure directly beneath the ship, on paper readouts, also in real time. We note the magnetic field intensity every 5 minutes and plot that on graph paper. That gives the crustal age, if you know the pattern of magnetic field reversals, and the chief scientist, Steve Cande, is a master at identifying magnetic anomalies. Within a few hours of the end of the day (0000 GMT, or 1 pm local time) we get digital versions of all the previous day’s data, and can work it on the 2 computers we brought out for that purpose. So, a lot is happening in the lab. I’m enjoying myself.<br><br>I’m adjusting to the routine. I’m on a quasi-24 hour cycle. I get a good 8 hours every other night, and about 4–5 hours on the others. I’ve started working out daily, weather permitting, on a rowing machine. That helps. We’ve had a little buffeting about this week, but it’s back to gentle seas just now.<br><br>Thinking of you.<br><br>Love, Bill", "GMT_date": "31-Jan-92", "GMT_time": "15:11:01", "long": -171.83736, "lat": -63.77325, "long_360": 188.16264 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 188.16264, -63.77325 ] } },

Thanks for your further detail about data gathering. I marvel at the navigational skill and aids that permit you to run such precision paths, which, I assume, are oriented at right angles to the ridge axis. Do you assure that bathymetric swaths “just touch” by matching features at the edges in flight or by trusting to navigation? All this must take practiced coordination. I’m all admiration. One day you must tell me more about the measuring instruments and the data processing.<br><br>We survived the first “serious” ski weekend! First, a little background. It’s been a weird winter for weather: precipitation nil or rain lately, high temps from the 20s to 40s, lows from upper teens to low 30s. Snow in town is still 4-10” but CRUSTY. So our expectations were pretty low, and I thought I’d have lots of company hiking. But--the first good omen was finding a great place to eat just north of Virginia on the drive up. Then, mirabile dictu, we found the snow at Northland deep with good texture. The land rises significantly from the lates, and most of the trail system is up on top. John Brainerd always leads us to the good trails up there that wind in and out of the beautiful border forest with occasional lengthy, undulating, gently downhill runs that give us chances now and then to catch our breath and recover our courage. But this year John couldn’t be there, and I couldn’t really ski--just walked on the road and lake. Mimi did ski, though, with the Johnsons and others through the woods to Slim Lake and then down an open trail that reaches Burntside near Widgiwagan, a couple of miles from the camp. I happened to meet them at the road crossing. I ramble, but we did have a good weekend with good people and will go back again next year.<br><br>My foot is much less swollen now--except for the big lump around my ankle. Hope I can ski at Gunflint where we spend Fri to Mon a.m., Feb 14-17, then back home Tues after a visit at Chubb Lake (near Carlton) with Pudge and Sarah Duncan. (I often visited there in high school and college days.) We hope the snow conditions on the border hold up until then.<br><br>The Olympic Games start this weekend.

I have very mixed feelings about the end of this extraordinary voyage. I’m very lucky. How many people get such an opportunity? I sense a lot of envy when I talked about the cruise beforehand, and it made me feel bad. But the envy was justified. But this wouldn’t be the same without the science, so it’s just a small group of us – 4 or 5 – who appreciate the experience the way I do. The close interaction with scientists I’ve known for years but who were always on different tracks, intersecting only infrequently, has contributed to the experience. I’ve always been sort of a loner, working independently on my own stuff. I think most scientists I know work the same way, until circumstances force us to cooperate. On this cruise, the mix is just right. Everybody has a different enough focus so that nobody feels crowded or overshadowed, but the blend is all harmonious, and the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Good magic.<br><br>I got an email message from Jamie today. I tried to send him something earlier, but figured I didn’t get through since he didn’t answer. I was right. I had the wrong address. So I’ve sent the previous letter to the new address. Hope it works this time. It was good to hear from him.<br><br>Despite the fullness of the experience, I’m about ready to head home. I’m planning some hiking in the Alps of the South Island in the few days between ship and plane. It will be good to be able to move around freely, and to find some solitude. It will also be good to get home and especially to see Janie. I miss her a lot. I’m worried about the readjustment to normal, fragmented life. I look forward to... I worry about... I’m going to miss... . As I said, mixed feelings.<br><br>Your email has been coming through. I think I have 1–5 complete. I find I get the urge to write about once a week. Then I write 3 or 4 letters all at once. It’s a little hard because I hate to repeat myself. The letters make a sort of journal. I’m saving them on the computer, and expect to look at them from time to time, maybe recapture some of the feelings. I know that three weeks from now, when I’ll be back on my home turf and caught up in familiar concerns and pursuits, this will all be a distant memory, like something I dreamed.<br><br>The Sea is calm now. It has been for the past two days. As we sail north on our drunken course, the weather becomes more normal, almost like real weather. We’ve had overcast about 99% of the voyage. I saw the stars once (sharing the sky with the aurora), the sun on just a handful of precious occasions, over the five weeks we’ve been in the far south. Now, I can actually see chunks of blue poking through the clouds. I don’t expect the calm to last. Overall the weather has been good. The biggest problem has been the fog. We’ve probably had a week of fog, cumulatively. We have to slow to 5 knots in the fog. The bridge gets nervous if they can’t see the icebergs until they take shape a couple hundred meters off the bow. Wimps. Yesterday we did 12 knots for about 8 hours, making up some of the lost time, and it felt great. Now, we’ve put the seismics back in the water so that top speed is 10 knots.<br><br>The picture of the sea floor that gradually took shape over the weeks, like an iceberg emerging from the fog bank, is extraordinary. The pictures (plural), really, since the data sets we collect tell different stories, which blend together to tell a larger story. Bill Ryan, a colleague whom we invited along for the ride, showed me something he wrote that develops the metaphor of a courtship – first, infatuation shaped by the superficial appearance and personality of the object of our attention, then a gradually deepening attachment as idiosyncracies are perceived and the true character takes shape. What can I say. We’ve been at sea for 5 weeks.<br><br>This is getting long. I started it last night, and now, after a good 7 hours of sleep (maybe I’m finally adjusting) it’s almost time to go on watch. And I still have to type this into the computer.

The trails are scenic and well laid out. We skied through the first and on the lake; we had visions of Gunflint Lake and the surrounding “mountains.” We ate too much and slept like logs.
